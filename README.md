# People table - react

In this prodject I use:
-React;
- students API;
- Type script;
- React-router;
- Bulma from style;
-  Multiple classnames with CSS Modules in React;

   In this app we have plugin  between two pages. Firs page it is Home page and second it is People page.

   In People page from server come list people. We render a table. And have interactive form with filters. We can filtred by query it's: name, father name and  mother name. By sex: male, female, all.
   By century: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.And we have the option to reset all filters.

   Also we cane sorted by name, sex, born, or died. Also we can select one person. This person light yellou.
